# Cryptographic report and function
This is a project introducing the basic of cryptographic primtives (hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption).
It covers what they are, how they work (basic), visual diagrams, functions to allow you to encrypt and decrypt messages from one another and hashing. 
Exlores strengths and weaknesses of each primitve and if there are any instances of combining elements of the primtives to create an overall stronger encryption method.
The other part of this is the attached report which goes into detail how they work, situations when you should use them over another cryptograhpic primitive and potential weakness of each. I also include two examples where you could combine two different cryptographic protocols to create a stronger secure system.
