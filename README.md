# Chatbot
This is a project introducing the basic of cryptographic primtives (hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption).
It covers what they are, how they work (basic), visual diagrams, functions to allow you to encrypt and decrypt messages from one another and hashing. 
Exlores strengths and weaknesses of each primitve and if there are any instances of combining elements of the primtives to create an overall stronger encryption method.
The other part of this is a chatbot which would convey this information to you just by using keywords.
If you wanted to know about the strengths of symmetric encryption, typing 'pros and cons symmetric encryption' or 'why are the benefits of symmetric encryption' should ideally yield the same results.
